OSINT-DB is a project created with the aim of centralizing data during investigations. At the current stage, it consists of a database containing only the necessary attributes and a terminal menu.
## Future Goals

It is planned to be added in future versions:
- Relationships between persons from the database with a graphic display
- Automatic collection of outputs from existing OSINT projects

## Usage

After starting the main.py file, it is necessary to select the **Setup database** option in the menu in order to create the database.

This process needs to be done only at the initial launch of OSINT-DB.

After initial setup, OSINT-DB is ready for data entry.

Data entry can be done manually one by one or through CSV and JSON files.

All output files will be created in the output folder.
